# **Graph Theory Project 2020**

## **Introduction**
<p>A program using the Python programming language that can build a non-deterministic finite automation (NFA) from a regular expression. This program will use the NFA to check if the regular expression matches any given string of text.<p>
  
<p>A regular expression is a string containing a series of characters, some of which may have a special meaning. <p>
	
<p>I decided to do a screencast for my project. It is a brief run through of how the program works. I have named it GraphTheoryScreencast and it is in the repository.</p>
	
<p>I have made more than 60 commits on this project. I just want to point out that over 20 of them are commits on updating the README/overview. The reason I have over 20 commits is because I forgot about the preview button. So every change I made, i was commiting it. I'm just informing you in case you were thinking that I done it to get a higher number of commits.</p>

<p>Also, please view the overview.md file in the repository. This file explains everything about the project.</p> 

* Which includes:
	* GitHub Repository Contents
	* How To Run The Program
	* Testing
	* The Algorithms within the progam
	* VIM
	* Research

<p>This is pitched at students in the year below me. The document is very long so I have created a Wiki page and split the file up into seperate pages.</p>
